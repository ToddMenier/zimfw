Installation
------------
Installing Zim is easy:

  * With curl:

        curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimfw/install/develop/install.zsh | zsh

  * With wget:

        wget -nv -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimfw/install/develop/install.zsh | zsh

Open a new terminal and you're done! Enjoy your Zsh IMproved! Take some time to
read about the [available modules] and tweak your `.zshrc` file.

If you have a different shell framework installed (like oh-my-zsh or prezto),
*uninstall those first to prevent conflicts*.

### Manual installation

1. Start a Zsh shell

       zsh

2. Set Zsh as the default shell:

       chsh -s =zsh

3. Copy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimfw/zimfw/develop/zimfw.zsh to
   `~/.zim/zimfw.zsh`.

4. Add the lines in the following templates to the respective dot files:
   * [~/.zimrc](https://github.com/zimfw/install/blob/develop/src/templates/zimrc)
   * [~/.zlogin](https://github.com/zimfw/install/blob/develop/src/templates/zlogin)
   * [~/.zshrc](https://github.com/zimfw/install/blob/develop/src/templates/zshrc)

5. Install the modules defined in `~/.zimrc` and build the static initialization script:

       source ~/.zim/zimfw.zsh install

Usage
-----

### zmodule

Add `zmodule` calls to your `~/.zimrc` file to define the modules to be initialized.
The modules are initialized in the same order they are defined. Add:

    zmodule <url> [-n|--name <module_name>] [options]

where `<url>` is the required repository URL or path. The following formats
are equivalent: `name`, `zimfw/name`, `https://github.com/zimfw/name.git`.

By default, the module name is the last component in the `<url>`. Use the
`-n|--name <module_name>` option to set a custom module name.

#### Repository options

* `-b|--branch <branch_name>`: Use specified branch when installing and
  updating the module. Overrides the tag option. Default: `master`.
* `-t|--tag <tag_name>`: Use specified tag when installing and updating the
  module. Overrides the branch option.
* `-z|--frozen`: Don't install or update the module.

#### Initialization options

* `-f|--fpath <path>`: Add specified path to `fpath`. The path is relative to
  the module root directory. Default: `functions`, if the subdirectory exists.
* `-a|--autoload <function_name>`: Autoload specified function. Default: all
  valid names inside the module's specified `fpath` paths.
* `-s|--source <file_path>`: Source specified file. The file path is relative
  to the module root directory. Default: the file with largest size matching
  `{init.zsh|module_name.{zsh|plugin.zsh|zsh-theme|sh}}`, if any exists.
* `-d|--disabled`: Don't use or clean the module.

### zimfw

Added new modules to `~/.zimrc`? Run:

    zimfw install

Removed modules from `~/.zimrc`? Run:

    zimfw clean-modules

Want to update your modules to their latest revisions? Run:

    zimfw update

Want to upgrade `~/.zim/zimfw.zsh` to the latest version?

    zimfw upgrade

For more information about the `zimfw` tool, run `zimfw` with no parameters.

Uninstalling
------------

The best way to remove Zim is to manually delete `~/.zim`, `~/.zimrc`, and
remove the initialization lines from your `~/.zshrc` and `~/.zlogin`.
